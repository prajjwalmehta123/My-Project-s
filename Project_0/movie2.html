    <h1>The Prestige</h1>
    <div id="review">
        This movie tore me in half. I wanted to love it with all my heart but *spoilers* the cloning machine was too fantastical
        to work in the film. It dedicated too strongly from its base it reality. This isn’t always an issue but it was such a
        massive mistake for a film that explore people who feign surpassing reality, when you explain a trick with “well a
        cloning machine existed in 1890” it cheapens the film. Now this is one small pet peeve of mine and if this sort of thing
        doesn’t bother you I can see this being the best film you’ve ever seen. It does everything right EXCEPT for that one
        mishap that works in its own way. Worth watching 100000% I’ll leave it up to you whether or not you enjoy the big twist.
        Personally I loved everyone about the twist except the part about the clones.
